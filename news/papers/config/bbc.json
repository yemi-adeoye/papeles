NAPE, currently at 46years, have created numerous opportunities for oil explorationists and geoscientists in Nigeria and today, at over 12000 registered members strong, we are privileged by the courageous act of this young man and his pioneering friends, many of whom are still with us till-date.\u201d",
            "The NAPE President revealed that his administration will kickstart as soon as he gets details of handing over from his predecessor Mrs. Patricia Ochogbu who has transitioned to become the immediate past President and acts on advisory capacity.",
            "According to Dr. Edet, \u201cIn the days ahead, focus will be on our future, but for now, it is imperative to truly reflect on the past years, especially the last two and stay thankful to the resilience of NAPE members, their learning and agile mindset and approach to delivery.

            "With these foregoing, Dr. Edet explained that NAPE will continue to create a strong platform for its members and member organization to continually seek the optimal value from exploration and production activities, as the association is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that oil and gas will remain a predominant source of energy in the next few decades, amidst the energy mix.",
            "\u201cFrom the outcome of our successful conference, we see that the pandemic truly endangered the health and safety of the environment, our industry, and its workforce, with most of our members still working from home or in skeletal rotations. This continues to emphasize our nation and continent\u2019s unique need of leading people out of energy poverty, hence climate change mitigation plans for us will continue to seek redress on creating a \u201cjust\u201d energy transition strategy for our nation as we all earnestly join forces to ensure that we support our member organizations to bring production up to an economically dependable level, keep the flare out and embrace other alternative energy source in the mix, as we transition.\u201d",

            "The NAPE President said in spite concerns of energy transition and the advent of renewables, fossil fuel still remain relevant in the value chain.",
            "On what NAPE will be doing in case oil is extinct arising from energy transition, he said other possibilities are in the industry that members can still be involved. Gas is a clean energy which also form part of the transition adding that Geoscience and other aspects evolve in the industry which members can do to keep afloat in the industry.",
            "Journalists also raised concerns about some IOCs which did not show their presence at the conference except for TotalEnergies which exhibited. Dr. Edet disclosed that due to Covid-19 some IOCs were busy to recover from work loss and sending their staff to exhibition might be difficult. However, some of them played active roles and participated in some of the sessions at the conference.",

            "The report also noted that the increase in trading surplus was due mainly to the increased sales of crude oil and gas by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an Upstream subsidiary of the NNPC, and the increased gas sales and depreciation postings by the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC).",

            "Speaking on the third day of the Practical Nigerian Content (PNC) Conference in Bayelsa, organised by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Group Executive Director, Gas and Power, NNPC, Abdulkabir Ahmed, also called for appropriate pricing for electricity to attract investment. He said to ensure cleaner energy sources, Nigeria had to refocus its energy mix, deepen the usage of gas, and draw funding into the sector.",
            "Ahmed pointed out that funding was a big challenge in the oil and gas industry, advising that the sector should leverage on technology and experience to weather the shortage of projects financing.",
            "\u201cToday, funding for fossil fuels is generally low and, therefore, it poses a lot of challenge. However, we cannot do without investment in this sphere. Therefore, we need to leverage on technology, leverage on industry experience, so as to produce more with less cost.",
            "\u201cThe second area that we look at is gas and power. Now, gas and power work together, because the power is fuelled by gas. So, in as much as you\u2019re looking at your opportunity, we have to look at where the gas will come from, who provides the gas?",
            "\u201cWhere do we also get the gas for use? Do we have adequate infrastructure to move the gas around, to utilise the gas for what is useful as well as put up adequate skills to ensure that we boost production, transmission and transportation?",
            "\u201cAll these are not obtainable except we have a transparent and market-driven gas market as well as electricity pricing. Without that, it will be difficult to go back to the upstream and put in money if you have no feasibility about upstream costs\u201d he said",
            "He noted that power generation was dependent on gas, especially for heavy duty industries, stressing that efforts are on to bring in vehicles that would run on gas as well as the skills to improve domestic gas production.",
            "Ahmed called for regional and international cooperation in the areas of gas production, transportation, and utilisation, especially for power generation.",
            "He said, \u201cWe need to develop an appropriate gas pricing as well as policies and investment packages. The Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) has done some significant improvement on some of the existing laws on gas.",
            "\u201cIt has opened up some bottlenecks that used to exist. Therefore, there are now several opportunities. Moreover, you have a lot of areas for investors to come in and put their money. They can look at auto vehicles, power plants can come, heavy industries, petrochemicals, fertilisers etc.\u201d",
            "In his remarks, Ogunleye stated that most of the gas production in the country was under the control of foreigners, stressing that the situation is worrying.",
            "He said, \u201cYou will find that the majority of gas projects and events are driven by foreign nationals and it is a concerning situation. And so, we need this task of continuously engaging with the public to expose them to the opportunities.",
            "\u201cGovernment has been pushing for gas development and the necessary environment has been created, whether through the PIA, the Decade of Gas, autogas, etc. All these are creating a spectrum of new opportunities around commercial opportunities. There are multiple opportunities even for small companies.",

            "The federal government is set to bring down the price of Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG) cooking gas through the reduction of tariff and taxes on imported LPG and it\u2019s accessories.",
            "The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipyre Sylva said that the government is planning to reduce the price of gas for the Yuletide.",
            "He stated that it was making efforts to reduce the cost of the commodity and make it affordable for Nigerians ahead of the Yuletide.",
            "However he pointed out that the government has no direct control over the rising prices of LPG, and cannot regulate it as it is an International commodity just like the crude oil",
            "Sylva, disclosed this on Tuesday after a meeting with the President, Muhammadu Buhari. At the meeting, Sylva formally presented the chief executives of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Farouk Ahmed and Gbenga Komolafe, respectively.",
            "Speaking on the reasons for LPG price hike, the minister said, \u201cCooking gas is not subsidised. It is already a deregulated commodity. So, the price of cooking gas is not determined by the government or by everybody in the industry. Gas prices are determined internationally.",
            "\u201cAnd you all are aware that in Europe today, gas prices have gone up. There was even crisis in Europe relating to gas prices. The pricing of gas internationally now affects also the price of gas in the country.",
            "\u201cApart from that, there are some issues around VAT charges on imported gas, and of course, taxes on imported gas, which we are handling. But of course, quite frankly, these taxes on imported gas, you must also juxtapose it with the local producers of gas.\u201d",
            "Sylva also said the President had directed him and his team to go and examine the oil spillage in Nembe, Bayelsa State.",
            "Speaking on what was behind the reappearance of queues in filling stations across the country, Ahmed said some of depot owners were selling petrol above the official ex-depot price of N148/litre, as they sold the product for as high as N157/litre.",
            "\u201cAnd the reason they adduced is that they are paying for their logistics such as shipping in dollars, they are also paying for NPA port charges and NIMASA charges in dollars,\u201d he said.",
            "The NMDPRA boss said the government had met with operators in the downstream sector on the matter, adding that efforts were on to settle the concerns."

        "paragraphs": [
            "Despite awareness, oil companies continue to flare gas, due partly to lack of infrastructure for processing and distribution to domestic and industrial users.",
            "Over the years, the federal government has made efforts to encourage investment in gas processing especially for the domestic market including providing incentives to oil companies.",
            "As part of the country\u2019s resolve to become a major player in the international gas market as well as to lay a solid framework for gas infrastructure expansion, the Nigerian Gas Master Plan was approved in 2008. The Gas Master Plan has yielded results with increased investment in gas but this progress could be derailed by the recent directive by the Federal Government which reduced the price of gas to power under Domestic Supply Obligation (DSO) from $2.50/Mscf to $2.18/Mscf.",
            "In a surprising move during the 2021 Gas Sector Stakeholders Forum held in Kano in July, President Muhammadu Buhari announced a reduction of the price of gas to power from $2.50 to $2.18, \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d.",
            "The President\u2019s comment was followed by a letter to Gas Aggregation Company of Nigeria (GACN) titled \u2018Ministerial Directive on Gas to Power in Nigeria\u2019 signed by Bitrus Nabasu, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, which conveyed the Ministerial approval for the gas price reduction.",
            "According to the letter, the Minister\u2019s approval was based on the recommendation by the Ministerial Gas Price Review Committee which was adopted by the Federal Government, organised labour and the Technical Ad-hoc Committee as prescribed by the National Gas Supply and Pricing Regulations 2008.",
            "Analysts in the oil and gas industry have observed that the price reduction, a consequence of pressure on the government by labour unions, will be counterproductive because it could dampen investors\u2019 appetite and impact gas supply to the domestic power market.",
            "According to data available on the International Energy Agency website, as of July 2021, gas was sold atc.$7/Mscfon the international gas market. This offers a more attractive opportunity for investors in the gas market.",
            "The Federal Government\u2019s move is reminiscent of the premium motor spirit (PMS) price-fixing which has held back investment in refining in the downstream sector.",
            "The labour unions\u2019 major argument is that a reduction in gas prices will translate to a reduction in electricity tariffs. However, industry analysts describe Labour\u2019s position as simplistic. Their view is that price should be determined by market forces of supply and demand rather than by executive fiat. There is currently no equilibrium in the domestic gas market. According to Mordecai Ladan, former Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Nigeria\u2019s daily gas production in 2019 was 1.2 billion standard cubic feet. Out of this volume, 41% is exported while 48% is retained for the domestic market. Flared gas accounts for 11% of the produced volume. With a domestic gas demand of over 1.4 billion standard cubic feet per day, the domestic market is supplied creating an imbalance which can be seen in the erratic supply to power generation plants for instance.",
            "A key reason why it does not make sense to reduce gas prices is that there is currently 40% liquidity in the gas to the power value chain. The government\u2019s focus should rather be on increasing liquidity to 100% which will assure suppliers of their payment as and when due.",
            "The gas price reduction could threaten the progress so far made in tackling gas flaring through gas monetisation. As of 2018, gas flaring accounted for nearly a quarter of Nigeria\u2019s total carbon dioxide emission, according to reports from the International Energy Agency and Nigeria\u2019s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency. On the other hand, PwC estimates that in the period between 2014 and 2018, the country lost an estimated $4.3 trillion to gas flaring.",
            "This sad situation was sustained by poor investment in gas processing infrastructure as investors were unwilling to commit to an economy with a history of policy instability. The price directive by the Federal Government is a confirmation of the fears of potential investors who were hesitant about investing in the gas market in the past.",
            "It could pull Nigeria back to those days when it was just not logical to invest in a gas processing facility because of low prices and an unstable policy environment.",
            "There are some implications of leaving Labour\u2019s relentless price push unchecked, according to Energy analysts. Firstly, investment in gas processing plants will stutter. Secondly, the price reduction for gas to power sector creates confusion/distortion for gas prices in the other market segments. Local distribution companies and other off-takers that are not in the gas to power value chain segment have started writing to suppliers to reduce pricing quoting the announcement by the Federal Government as a basis. The government needs to provide clarification on this. Thirdly, Generating Companies (Gencos) will again be starved of much-needed gas.",
            "In the end, the Nigerian electricity consumer will suffer and the country\u2019s hope of becoming a gas super-power will remain an illusion.",
            "At present, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stand at 206.5 trillion standard cubic feet (TCF) according to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), whereas proven crude oil reserves are 36.9 billion barrels. By 2030, the DPR says Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves will increase to 230TCF. This projection will be a mirage without increased investment to harness the abundant gas reserves.",
            "Also, it is estimated that Nigeria will need circa $400 billion between now and 2050 to power over 25 million homes. Gas is critical to powering these homes because nearly 90% of power plants in the country are gas-fired.",
            "If potential investors are muzzled with price control and poorly coordinated policies in the guise of reducing the cost of electricity tariffs how will the nation attract the necessary investment in gas to increase power generating capacity?",
            "In addition, gas producers will be forced to sell their output in the international gas market since pricing is more favourable and revenue is in dollars.",
            "There are several gas producers who have sourced funding in dollars based on certain price projections. The gas price reduction could derail their projections, impede their ability to repay loans sourced from banks and drive them out of business. Given that gas, infrastructure is funded in dollars but with revenues generated in Naira, government needs to provide viable concessionary infrastructure funding in Naira to further encourage investment in the upstream and midstream gas sectors.",
            "Of even deeper consequence is the implication of more flares emerging across the Niger Delta because of poorly conceived policies. Oil and gas exploration companies have been flaring a lot of gas across oil-producing communities in the Niger Delta every day. And community dwellers like Esoke have been at the receiving end, often complaining that the flares cause heat, damage to the eyes and general health.",
            "Since 2015, the price of gas for power generation under DSO has remained $2.50/Mscf notwithstanding changes in the international market as well as increases in the cost of gas infrastructure and cost inflation generally. Therefore, reducing the price of gas for power generation is not the right approach to deal with the power shortages and electricity tariff in Nigeria.",
            "The Solution",
            "The willing-buyer -willing-seller approach or market-driven pricing regime is a veritable solution for Nigeria to fully adopt. Improper price regulations and subsidies do not support the robust growth of the gas and power sectors. This explains why the liquidity issue in the power value chain has continued to linger.",
            "Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo indeed stated in 2019 that the willing-buyer- willing-seller policy is one of the surest steps to addressing Nigeria\u2019s power challenges. Speaking at a town hall organised by Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association (LERSA) in Lagos ahead of the governorship election last year, Prof. Osinbajo said: \u201cWe have what we call the eligible customer declaration, which is, if you are able to generate power, you can sell your power on a willing-buyer or willing-seller basis\u201d.",
            "\u201cWe think that to solve Nigeria\u2019s problem is not to rely on the grid, but to decentralise so that more power companies can produce power where they would sell at a tariff that will not be regulated. At the moment, one of the problems that Discos have is that the tariff is regulated, and it is not cost-reflective. In other words, it is not enough to cover the cost of distributing the power. So, this willing-buyer-willing-seller is one that we think will solve the problems. We believe that the way to go is this willing-buyer, willing-seller for industries, homes etc. \u201d, he said."

            "Oyebanji, who is the Managing Director of 11 Plc, however, faulted the plan to replace the subsidy with cash transfer to Nigerians due to lack of a reliable data base in the country.",

            "An oil and gas expert, Mr Wilson Opuwei, said the conversation about fuel subsidy in Nigeria should have been a thing of the past because it was an obvious wastage of the nation\u2019s resources.",
            "Opuwei, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Dateline Energy Services Limited, maintained that the elites were the major beneficiaries of the fuel subsidy regime.",
            "He said: \u201cWe should let market forces determine the price of petrol and other products, not government dolling out subsidies with funds that we don\u2019t even have.",
            "\u201cWhat government should be doing is to create enabling environment for businesses to thrive, and once Nigerians are economically empowered, we will not be having this debate on petrol subsidy.\u201d"

            "Fayemi added that the failure of the NNPC to remit funds into the federation account was responsible for the decision of his administration, for instance, to slash the subvention of Ekiti State University (EKSU).",
            "A review of the figures released by the NNPC during the November FAAC presentation showed that between January and October, the company was barely able to meet a third of its obligation to the federation.",
            "In January, the national oil company paid N90.8 billion of the N209.3 billion projection; in February it remitted N64.16 billion and in March, the NNPC paid N41.1 billion into the federation account.",
            "But in April, it paid nothing to the three tiers of government; in May it was N38.608 billion; in June it paid N47.16 billion while in July it remitted N67.2 billion.",
            "Things appeared better in August, when NNPC remitted N80 billion to the joint account, but it fell again to N67.533 billion in September, before slumping to N14.85 billion in October.",
            "Although the mandatory cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last year initially played a role in the inability of NNPC to meet its obligation to the federation, ageing upstream infrastructure, oil theft and outright sabotage have combined to hobble the country\u2019s oil production.",
            "Nigeria has been unable to meet even the tapered production quota allocated to it by OPEC, thereby further reducing its total crude oil export, coupled with the subsidy payment, which continues to eat deep into the national oil company\u2019s resources.",
            "NNPC will again make a deduction of roughly N200 billion from the joint federal, state and local government account when the FAAC meets later this month to share the statutory monthly allocation.",
            "Analysis of the document detailing the presentation of the national oil company to FAAC in November, indicated that the N200 billion will be the highest amount deducted by NNPC since it resumed payment of petroleum subsidies in February this year.",
            "In all, it further showed that NNPC has removed at least N1.027 trillion from monies accruing to the three tiers of government in the country between February and October as payment for the controversial petrol under-recovery.",
            "A breakdown of the various deductions indicated that payments have increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year."

            "Reacting to claims that the poor supply of electricity was due to lack of generation, the Executive Secretary, Association of Power Generation Companies, Joy Ogaji, said Gencos were not dispatching at full capacity due to the poor utilisation of what they produce.",
            "She said, \u201cThere may be many reasons for the \u2018seemingly perceived poor or lack of generation. I want to state for the records that no single generation company is allowed, by the system, to send out its available capacity.",

            "Ikeja Electric Plc (IE), Nigeria\u2019s largest electricity Distribution Company has cautioned members of the public to desist from erecting structures under power lines or carrying out activities and trading near electrical installation, which in effect exposes them to risk of electrocution.The DisCo noted that proximity to installations such as transformer, electric poles or power lines contravenes the extant law, therefore people in such locations should vacate those areas urgently in order to protect their lives and property.According to the Head of Quality, Health, Safety & Environment (QHSE) for Ikeja Electric (IE), Engr. Jamiu Badmos, the warning became necessary because it has been observed that such acts are perpetrated with impunity irrespective of the dangers associated with such violations. He also noted that Ikeja Electric in line with its Quality, Health, Safety and Environment (QHSE) policy consistently sensitizes customers on the dangers of trading and building near, around or under power lines.He also disclosed that the company has spent over N200m in the last one year on the purchase of different types of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as well as organizing interactive occupational health and safety training for employees, whilst also reiterating the company\u2019s commitment to entrench a value driven safety culture that goes over and beyond safety requirements to build a world class safety conscious environment.Speaking on the defiance of the law guiding proximity to power installations, Badmos said that Section 3.1 of the Nigerian Electricity Supply and Installation Standards (NESIS) Regulation 2015 stipulates a mandatory distance of 5.5 meters, 15 meters and 25 meters setback from 33/11kV, 132kV and 330kV lines respectively. However, some members of the public have continued to violate the law, making them vulnerable to the risk of unfortunate incidents, which sometimes result in fatalities.\u201cAs a responsible and safety conscious organization, safety enlightenment is top priority and we constantly sensitize members of the public on the dangers of improper handling of electrical issues through our Public Safety Sensitization Programme (PSSP). This presents the opportunity to articulate the required safety measures such as appropriate rating of materials, proper installation and maintenance of earthing on buildings, curbing illegal technicians and vandalization of network infrastructure, dangers of building and trading under powerlines,\u201d he explained.The DisCo recently embarked on a SafeAware initiative at all Customer Service touchpoints and other strategic locations across the Business network in an effort to embed attitudinal change to safety practices amongst staff and customers.To ensure compliance with the safety standard, Badmos called on \u201cthe Federal and State Government as a matter of urgency, to harmonize efforts to find a lasting solution to this issue by wielding the big stick on defaulters while DisCos continue to sensitize customers on the inherent dangers associated with continued violation of safety practices.\u201dIkeja Electric remains committed to raising the bar on safety standards in the Power Sector with the safety and well-being of Customers, and will continue to uphold this as top priority"

            "By Engr. Gbenga Komolefe, NUPRC CEO",
            "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has reiterated its commitment to tackle oil spills in the Nigerian oil and gas sector in fulfillment of its regulatory mandate as enshrined in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, Petroleum Act and the Petroleum (Drilling and Production) Regulations and subsidiary legislations.",
            "This assurance has become necessary following concerns trailing the oil spill incident of November 3, 2021 which occurred at the Santa Barbara Well 1 operated by AITEO Eastern Exploration and Production Company in Bassambiri, Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.",
            "The Commission will continue to monitor the site situation and guide the operator until the spill and its attendant problems are completely addressed. This includes but is not limited to implementing all effective physical and engineering solutions to the incident, managing the safety of the response providers and people in the neighbouring communities and educating the general public on the site situation periodically.",
            "In specific terms, the Commission will ensure that the pressure from the well is stopped to put an end to the oil release, the already released oil is appropriately contained and skimmed off as it is being released, a joint investigation visit (JIV) is conducted as soon as it is safe to do so, cleanup and restorative actions are done immediately after the spill is stopped and compensation paid to affected communities timeously and in accordance with the law.",
            "We appreciate the concerns raised in different quarters following the incident and wish to inform the general public and our stakeholders that the Commission has taken all necessary steps alongside the relevant stakeholders to ensure that the situation does not degenerate further.",
            "It was confirmed that upon receiving the report of the incident, the operator, AITEO mobilized immediately for preliminary assessment of site conditions and based on the specific site requirements, positioned containment booms to isolate the spill source and prevent oil from spreading further; while also cordoning off the area to prevent injuries to people and fire from any possible ignition source.",
            "It also called in Boots and Coots, a well disaster management company, from the US, to cap the pressure and stop further spill. Clean Nigeria Associates (CNA) was also engaged to contain and recover the oil as well as manage and protect the immediate environment. The company has continually updated the NUPRC on site conditions and their action steps.",
            "On receipt of reports of the incident by the Commission, our field operations team were promptly mobilised and are currently on ground for regulatory oversight assessment to determine probable cause(s) and to ensure all response actions are the most appropriate and effective to return normalcy in the shortest possible time.",
            "Apart from checking to confirm that the company is carrying out the necessary response measures to contain the situation, the Commission has made its officials available to participate in containment procedures that are considered safe by the experts at this moment. Initial spill report has been received and appropriately reviewed and documented while updates are received diligently.",
            "When the incident occurred, the Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and the Commission\u2019s Chief Executive visited communities around the spill site to brief them of safety measures already put in place as well as assure them of the commitment of the Commission to sort out the situation in the shortest possible time. Relevant and verified information about the development are also being released routinely to the public to avoid misinformation.",
            "In line with our statutory responsibility, operations at the site is under the supervision of the Commission and efforts are on-going to contain the spill, stop the flow, control and clean-up the spill.",
            "Our preliminary investigations have revealed that there were no fatalities in the incident. However crude oil and gas were seen gushing out from valves close to the top of the wellhead at high pressure but without any associated fire. The water surrounding the wellhead was polluted with oil. The affected well had been previously shut-in and therefore not producing at the time of incident.",
            "While the incident is to be treated with care and the location approached with caution by only those authorized to do so, the Commission wishes to reiterate that there is no cause for panic. This is because on a routine basis and under the supervision of relevant teams from the Commission, all petroleum companies are mandated to conduct drill exercises to adequately prepare for all eventualities.",
            "Under this arrangement, such companies are required to document all necessary response actions in their Oil Spill Contingency Plan which is routinely and painstakingly reviewed by the Commission; and which is to be activated for response in emergency situations. Details of the regulatory requirements are contained in the PIA 2021 and further enunciated in the EGASPIN 2018. These form the basis of our strategic focus to achieve zero incidences going forward.",
            "As part of our strategic plans for incident management, the operators have been mandated to activate Environmental Management Plans (EMP) which includes Environmental Compliance Monitoring (ECM) among other response actions. At the end of the clean-up exercise, the Commission will supervise all the operators to conduct Post Impact Assessment (PIA) studies to determine the far-reaching effects of the spills, with a view to restoring all impacted environment as near as possible to their pristine state.",
            "The general public and all stakeholders are hereby assured that the Commission is taking every necessary action to ensure that the spills and associated incidents have the least impact on the affected communities and the environment."

            "The planned withdrawal of fuel subsidy by the Federal Government by the end of the first half of 2022 is currently generating heated arguments among Nigerians and stakeholders alike.",
            "While the World Bank has decried the continued spending by the Nigerian government on petrol subsidy, which it said is on track to gulp up to N2.9 trillion this year, the claims by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that the country consumes over 60 million litres of fuel daily has been faulted by stakeholders.",
            "According to an exclusive report by Daily Sun in June 2021, the huge subsidy figure is further compounded by the possession of 40 dormant refinery licenses by oil firms.",
            "Citing documents from the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) now Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), it was revealed that the dormant refinery licenses dipped Nigerian refining capacity by 1,862,000 million barrels per day (bpd).",
            "The DPR refinery license status report indicated that as at May 2021, a total of 68 refineries license and approval had been granted, out of which 40 are inactive.",
            "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had during a panel session at the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit (NES#27) in October in Abuja. said that full deregulation of the of the downstream oil and gas sector would start by July 2022.",
            "Though industry observers are in doubt of the full implementation of deregulation as the Federal Government had on several occasions claimed to have exited the subsidy regime, only to re-introduce the same when prices of crude oil begin to surge.",
            "Ahmed said that the Federal Government would only cater for subsidy on petrol in the first six months of 2022.",
            "In seven months, petrol subsidy payments gulped N714 billion, shrinking monthly revenue accrued to the federation account.",
            "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is currently the sole importer of petrol, has been deducting subsidy payments from oil and gas proceeds due to the three tiers of government since there is no provision for it in the 2021 budget.",
            "\u201cIn our 2022 budget, we only factored in subsidy for the first half of the year; the second half of the year, we are looking at complete deregulation of the sector, saving foreign exchange and potentially earning more from the oil and gas industry,\u201d she said.",
            "But a management consultant/oil and gas policy advisor, Mr Micheal Faniran, said that the continued payment of fuel subsidy is a violation of the Petroleum Industry Act, adding that the president was not complying with the provisions of the Act and could be sued for that breach.",
            "He said the money being spent on fuel subsidy for several years could have been channeled to infrastructural development that would impact positively on the living conditions of Nigerians.",
            "\u2018\u2018Currently, the price of crude oil is over $80 per barrel which ordinarily should be good news for Nigerians, but the reverse is the case because the larger chunk of the country\u2019s oil revenue is again ploughed back to subsidy which comes through petrol imports as a result of the comatose state of the refineries,\u2019\u2019 he pointed out.",
            "He admitted that the immediate impact of withdrawal of fuel subsidy will translate to higher cost of fuel, assuring that as more players come into the market through healthy competition the prices would drop.",
            "Faniran cited the case of the telecoms sector, saying at inception, only fewer Nigerians could afford to purchase the SIM card, but that today, SIM cards are even given out for free and in the cases where they are sold, it comes at a paltry sum.",
            "He argued that the continued payment of fuel subsidy was not sustainable as the country\u2019s debt services to revenue ratio are poles apart.",
            "On his part, the Partner, Bloomfield Law Practice, Dr Ayodele Oni, said that he always felt that subsidy was a bad idea in the long term, for the electricity and downstream petroleum sectors.",
            "Subsidy, according to him, encourages corruption and inefficiency in the two sectors which should thrive only on efficiency.",
            "\u201cFurther, government revenues cannot continue to sustain subsidy. What should be done instead is to reduce the need for petroleum products by ensuring the power sector works as many people will substantially reduce their need to buy petroleum products if the electric power sector works.",
            "\u201cRather than have subsidy, government should set up well run social programmes for the most vulnerable and the poorest people as is done elsewhere. We need records, honesty and competence in public service and politics to achieve those.",
            "\u201cWe also require strong institutions. If the electric power and transportation sectors work, reliance on petroleum products will reduce substantially. Then the debate around subsidy will weaken tremendously.",

He also advocated for total deregulation also in the power sector so that the economy can just move in the direction it should move.",

            "On how a just transition can be ensured in the country, he said, we should just take the petrol subsidies away and invest in renewable energy, especially solar, wind and a few others so that any village or anybody in Nigeria can have access to electricity.",
            "Festus Osifo, President of Petroleum and Natural Gas Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) said while organized labour is not opposed to deregulations, it is difficult for the government to transfer its inefficiencies to the masses. He said what has happened over the years is that we have governments that are just inefficient.",

He said since the mid-1990s the direction of labour has been government, why not fix the refineries. So that the foreign component that goes into the costing would be eliminated.",
            "Just imagine today, people working in refineries are Nigerians, you will pay them in Naira. So when you are, when the dollar is appreciated against the Naira, at the end of the day, the manpower is stabilized. The cost of labour is in Naira and not in dollars. So the only thing you now price in the dollar is the cost of crude oil.\u201d",
            "He said what the organized labour told the government is that fix the refineries, when the refineries are working we would support you to deregulate, that what they don\u2019t want is import drive deregulation. But it should be based on local production.",
            "He said that there has been trust deficit that has existed between the government and the people over the years.",
            "If the privatization of the power sector has been done in Germany, or South Africa, it would have been successful, but since they sold them to their friends the exercise has been a failure. And after selling the Gencos and Discos to their friends they ended up lending them the taxpayer\u2019s money to run this enterprise. Which were grossly undervalued?\u201d",
            "He said they are supporting deregulation but it must be based on local production.",
            "Adeola Yusuf of Platform Africa said lack of trust has been the reason why the people are not supporting Government. He said the government has been talking to people and not communicating with the people. Because the government is not communicating with the people."

            "The statement noted that harnessing these huge gas resources, and on time too, is key in the next decade of Nigeria\u2019s existence.",
            "According to Shell boss the second approach for Nigeria\u2019s successful energy transition would be an intentional growth of the off-grid power and renewables industry taking advantage of foreign financial support and technology transfer.",
            "\u201cThe ongoing energy transition is here with us. As with other transitions, it is a journey that will involve multiple approaches, collective action and undoubtedly present new challenges and opportunities. Nigeria is well positioned to ride the wave of the current energy transition with its abundance of natural fossil fuels and renewable solar energy. We need to move with a greater sense of urgency and a clear sense of direction,\u201d he said.",
            "Okunbor, who is also the Managing Director of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), said, \u201cNigeria, as a country with abundant natural fossil fuel resources, cannot afford for international and multilateral agencies to stop funding the development of fossil fuels, particularly gas projects.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe transition is underway,\u201d Okunbor said, \u201cbut it will move at different paces and produce different outcomes in different countries depending on local factors. Society, as a whole, faces a dual challenge to transition to a low-carbon energy future, dealing with how to manage the risk of climate change, while also extending the benefits of energy to everyone on the planet. This is a challenge that requires changes in the way energy is produced, used and made accessible to people.\u201d",
            "Despite the efforts at decarbonisation, Okunbor said oil and gas would remain in the energy mix for some decades to come. \u201cThis is partly a consequence of the time needed for renewables to reach the necessary level of materiality. In part, it is also a consequence of the lack of substitution options in some parts of the economy. But the world will need to meet its energy needs at the same time as it tackles climate change.\u201d",
            "He noted that to make the Federal Government\u2019s Decade of Gas agenda a success, the country would need to unlock the domestic gas-to-power value chain; accelerating infrastructure development; drive gas-based industrialisation; and deepen domestic liquefied petroleum gas penetration.",
            "In addition, he said there was a need to build a stable regulatory environment anchored on a willing-buyer-willing-seller pricing regime; grow the export and regional gas market; and build local capacity and content for contractors and professionals in the gas sector.",
            "He said \u201cA transformation of the global economy is required, especially in the power sector, transport, buildings, and industry \u2013 four main areas where energy is consumed and that produce a significant proportion of energy-related emissions of CO2.",
            "He also advocated a significant shift in the consumption of energy in power, transportation, buildings and industry as key areas that will determine the long-term energy mix. \u201cTo tackle climate change, power generation, for example, must evolve to use a combination of more renewable sources of energy, as well as natural gas \u2013 the cleanest-burning of the hydrocarbon fuels.\u201d",
            "On how Shell was responding to the challenge of access to energy and the global drive to grow the renewable energy sector, Okunbor said the global energy giant had made significant targeted investments on the platform of Shell\u2019s Energy Access team and the Shell-seeded impact investing company, All On, to help close Nigeria\u2019s energy gap.",
            "\u201cSo far, All On has invested over $21mln in 40 off-grid energy companies in Nigeria and has driven over 40,000 solar connections across Nigeria to date,\u201d he said."

            "NUPENG said it would commence a nationwide strike if some legitimate welfare and membership-related issues are not conclusively addressed at the end of the period.",
            "The ultimatum was contained in a statement released on Monday and signed by Williams Akhoreha, NUPENG president, and Olawale Afolabi, general secretary.",
            "The union had reached its decision during a special national delegates conference convened last Thursday.",
            "It listed reasons for its resolution to include non-payment of workers\u2019 salaries, title benefits, among others.",
            "\u201cWe write to convey to the general public and all relevant government agencies the resolution of the special national delegates conference to issue a 14-day notice of a nationwide industrial action if some legitimate welfare and membership related issues that have been variously resolved in our favour even by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment are not adequately and conclusively addressed and resolved within the next 14 days. This ultimatum takes effect from Monday, November 15, 2021,\u201d the statement reads.",
            "Outlining some of the issues, the union said the first one was the outstanding short payment of terminal benefits to its members that were declared redundant in 2012 by the management of Chevron Nigeria Limited.",
            "It also accused the management of Chevron of terminating the employment of contract workers for joining the union.",
            "This, it said, was despite the fact that the workers had put in between 10 to 20 years in continuous employment and that their jobs were terminated without payment of terminal benefits.",
            "\u201cThere is also the matter concerning PYRAMIDT workers, who for more than 20 years now are being moved from one labour contractor to another without conditions of service and union representation/recognition,\u201d NUPENG added.",
            "The union said that contract workers working in oil mining licence (OML) 42 of the Nigeria Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an upstream subsidiary company of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), were being continuously owed salaries and allowances for upwards of eight to 10 months.",
            "NUPENG said efforts to make the management of the NPDC and the contractors do the needful on the pitiable plights of the hapless workers had yet to receive any meaningful attention and actions.",
            "\u201cNigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC) and its Contractors are also owing Contracts Workers\u2019 salaries and allowances for upwards of 10 months,\u201d the statement adds.",
            "\u201cThese workers are being denied salaries and allowances on very inhuman and wicked excuses that the contractors are yet to fulfill certain due process, yet this due process is not stopping NAOC from exploiting the skills and sweats of these Nigerians for profits while the workers and their families are wallowing in hardship and poverty.",
            "\u201cIn a similar manner, NAOC has since early 2020 been using the excuse of COVID-19 to keep several of our members away from work while using casual/daily paid workers to do their work even while there is a subsisting contract.",
            "\u201cThe Special National Delegates Conference in session noted with deep disappointment that despite the fact that these issues have been tabled before different government agencies/institutions and they have been resolved, the decisions remain unimplemented while our members keep suffering in excruciating jeopardy.",
            "\u201cIt was therefore resolved and directed that these issues do not require any further meetings or negotiations but decisive actions and implementation of all established issues within the period of our notice to all concerned.\u201d"

            "The CEO urged indebted marketers that collect bridging levies provided for in the pricing template to remit such deductions to enable the Authority pay outstanding claims.",
            "The stakeholders met in Lagos on the 9th November, 2021 where it was agreed that all the stakeholders should fulfil their mandates to ensure seamless distribution of petroleum products nationwide as the yuletide season approaches."

            "The international oil companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria have once again expressed satisfaction over the new legal framework for the oil industry- the PIA which they insist is the needed panacea for attracting investment into the Petroleum industry in Nigeria.",
            "The oil majors, who recognised the ongoing energy transition, its inevitability and impact on fossil fuels industry, however, called for caution and moderation among Nigerian players in their quest to move to new energies.",
            "Chief executives of the IOCs stated these at a panel session on, \u201cGrowth Levers and Investment Opportunities Arising from Nigeria\u2019s Petroleum Industry Act,\u201d at the ongoing 10th Practical Nigerian Content, organised by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB).",
            "The central theme of the four-day event holding both physically and virtually in Yenogoa, Bayelsa State, is, \u201cDriving Nigerian Content in the New Dawn of the Petroleum Industry Act.\u201d",

            "Speaking, Sangster, who was represented at the discourse by the Deputy Managing Director, TotalEnergies Deep-water, Mr. Victor Bandele, said the PIA had come at a better time, adding that his organisation was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Act.",
            "He said the Act has paid greater attention to gas, which according to him, is a transition fuel for Nigeria and very critical to the government\u2019s drive to industrialise the nation.",
            "Sangster explained that TotalEnergies worldwide was becoming a multi-energy company, stating that the company\u2019s energy mix will change significantly in the coming years.",
            "He said, \u201cCurrently, our production is about 55 per cent oil, 40 per cent gas, and five per cent electricity. But by 2030, it will be 50 per cent gas; 35 per cent oil; and 15 per cent electricity.",
            "\u201cBy 2050, the mix is targeted to be 40 per cent renewable power, 40 per cent gas (primarily carbon-free) and 20 per cent liquid products. Out target is to get to Net Zero in all our operations worldwide by 2050. We are committed to this target and working with all our stakeholders, we believe we can deliver cleaner, more affordable, and more available energy to as many people as possible.\u201d",
            "Kennedy, who was represented by Chevron\u2019s Director of Business Services, Mr. Cosmas Iwueze, said the PIA has done a lot in terms of liberalising gas, adding that gas is a transition fuel for them.",
            "He said, \u201cThe world economies have to be powered and gas is major transition fuel. So, we are focusing on lower sources of energy. The PIA has really done a good job by liberalising gas.\u201d",
            "Also, Okunbor said the PIA has created an enabling environment for investment to thrive, noting that in the past, discussions had been about enduring certainty in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.",
            "He said industry players should take energy transition very important because of its impact on oil and gas, pointing out that over 55 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s foreign earnings come from oil."
